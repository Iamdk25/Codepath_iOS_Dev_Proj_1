# Project 1 - **WORDLE**

Submitted by: **Divyarajsinh Karmariya**

WORDLE is an app that provides you with an interactive experience in the world of words. The app will generate a random word which the user will have to guess with limited number of chances for each word. With each guess, you'll receive clues that indicate which letters are included in the word and where they're located. You aim to use these clues to guess the secret word before running out of attempts.

Time spent: 3 hours spent in total

## Notes

There were many challanges while making this app. I was very new to the Swift language and its syntax. But due to Swift being similar to C I was able to get a grasp of the language in some time. There were also a lot of errors that I faced while building the app which were majorly due to lack of understanding of the libraries and functinalities I can use by using Swift but I tried my level best to overcome them. I hope you enjoy playing with words!
